# Data Structures And Algorithms Course Repository

This repository contains the solutions for problems from the data structure course textbook, as well as relevant resources. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for students to collaborate and share their solutions.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide easy access to the course textbook for all students and facilitate collaboration by sharing solutions to the problems. The textbook, "Data Structures and Algorithms In Java" by Nosrat Ali Ashrafi Payaman, is a recommended reference for the course.

To ensure accessibility, the textbook has been scanned and converted into PDF format. You can download the PDF from the [Releases](https://github.com/amirkhaki/DSA/releases) page of this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a chapter from the textbook. Within each chapter folder, you will find various programming language folders (e.g., `C++`, `Java`, `Python`) that contain solutions to the problems discussed in that chapter.
```
├── 01_recursive_algorithms
│ ├── cpp
│ ├── java
│ └── python
├── 02_calculating_the_complexity_of_algorithms
│ ├── cpp
│ ├── java
│ └── python
```
Feel free to explore the repository and contribute your own solutions in your preferred programming language. If a folder for your programming language doesn't exist, you can create one and organize your solutions accordingly.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged! If you would like to contribute your solutions, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your solutions: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
3. Add your solutions to the appropriate chapter and programming language folders.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add solutions for Chapter X in language Y"`.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

Please ensure that your solutions are well-documented and follow the best practices of the respective programming language.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Danial Khalaji for providing access to the course textbook and allowing its scanning to create an accessible version. Their contribution has greatly enhanced the learning experience for all students.

If you find the textbook helpful, I encourage you to consider supporting the author and publisher by purchasing a copy.
